    "text": "Visualizing missing values\nmissingno offers visualizations for two main purposes - reporting missing rows and columns, and checking the relation of missing values among columns. Let’s begin by checking out the first type.\n\n1. Matrix\nThe following code helps us visualize the missing values in a matrix\n\nmsno.matrix(df)\n\n&lt;AxesSubplot:&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nThis plot shows us the pattern of missingness across columns. White lines indicate missing values. A quick glance can tell you if there’s a pattern or if the missingness is random. As we see above, the YR_RMDL (year in which building was remodeled) column has the most missing values, followed by the PRICE column.\nNote - As will become clearer in the subsequent examples, looking at visuals will not be meaningful beyond 50 columns.\n\n\n2. Barplot.\nThe Bar chart is a quick-check tool to see how many non-missing values we have per column.\n\nmsno.bar(df)\n\n&lt;AxesSubplot:&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Heatmap\nThe missingno heatmap is a tool for exploring the relationship between missing values in different variables within a dataset. This heatmap focuses on nullity correlation, which essentially tells us how the presence or absence of one variable impacts another. The algorithm behind this heatmap filters out variables that don’t significantly contribute to the analysis. This means variables that are consistently non-null or always null are excluded because they don’t provide useful correlation information.\nEntries marked &lt;1 or &gt;-1 hint at near-perfect negative or positive relationships with a few exceptions. These exceptions are important as they might indicate irregularities or errors in the data.\nThe heatmap is a great tool for visualizing and understanding pairwise relationships in terms of data completeness, its utility starts to taper off when dealing with more complex relationships or extremely large datasets. I\n\nmsno.heatmap(df)\n\n&lt;AxesSubplot:&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4. Dendrogram\nThe dendrogram in missingno offers a more comprehensive view of variable completion correlations, going beyond the pairwise analysis seen in the correlation heatmap. It employs a hierarchical clustering algorithm from the SciPy library to assess variables against each other based on their nullity correlation. This is done by evaluating binary distance, where the algorithm iteratively groups variables in a way that minimizes the distance within these clusters. A key aspect of this process is that variables with similar patterns of missingness are clustered together.\nWhen you look at a dendrogram, you’re essentially reading a story of variable correlation from the top down. Points where cluster leaves join at zero indicate a perfect prediction of one variable’s presence by another’s. This could mean scenarios where one variable is always empty when another is filled, or they might consistently mirror each other’s state (both being empty or filled).\nFor instance, in a specific dataset, the dendrogram might cluster together variables that are mandatory and therefore always present. Leaves that are close but not exactly at zero suggest a strong, albeit not perfect, correlation. Such nuances are crucial for data analysts, as they highlight potential mismatches or anomalies in the dataset. If, according to your understanding of the data, certain columns should match in their presence or absence, the dendrogram can quantify the extent of mismatches. This insight could inform decisions on how many values need to be adjusted to align with expected patterns.\n\n# Dendrogram\nmsno.dendrogram(df)\n\n&lt;AxesSubplot:&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nThe diagram suggests that “PLACES”, “BEDRM”, “ROOMS”, and “STORIES” have very similar patterns of missingness, hence they are clustered closely together. “AYB” and “YR_RMDL” merge at a higher point than “PLACES”, “BEDRM”, “ROOMS”, and “STORIES”, suggesting that “AYB” and “YR_RMDL” are less similarly missing compared to the other cluster.\nWhere clusters join together at the very bottom, it could suggest that the presence or absence of one variable is a good predictor for the presence or absence of the other within the same cluster."
